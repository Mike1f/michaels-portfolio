		<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>

		<p>Hello, my name is Michael Figueroa. I'm going to get a job in I.T. because I love technology and I want to help
			people with their technical problems. I'm taking a coding boot camp and I'm planning on taking more classes
			within the I.T. field to achieve this career choice.</p>

		<h2>Weekly Evaluation</h2>

		<ul>Week 0 of the boot camp was really good. We reviewed creating and deploying repositories as well as learning
			how to create Personas and Use/Case Interaction Flows. We gor into groups when learning these subjects so not
			only did I learn a lot, I also got to talk with and interact with my classmates which was a great experience.
			Looking forward to next week.</ul>

		<ul>Week 1 of the boot camp went great. We got to learn about Object Oriented PHP. wel learned about classes,
			getter and setter methods, traits, and .json files. As for the Pro Dev side of things we got ton  do an activity
			where we picked two random pictures that had to represent where we were in the present and where we wanted to
			be 3 years in the future. It was a really fun activity because not only did I get more of an idea on what I
			wanted in my future, I also got to see what my peers were at now and where they wanted for their future, so it
			was really interesting to see that.</ul>
