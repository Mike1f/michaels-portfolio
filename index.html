		<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Michael Figueroa. I'm going to get a job in I.T. because I love technology and I want to help
			people with their technical problems. I'm taking a coding boot camp and I'm planning on taking more classes
			within the I.T. field to achieve this career choice.</p>
		<h2>Weekly Evaluation</h2>
		<p>Week 0 of the boot camp was really good. We reviewed creating and deploying repositories as well as learning
			how to create Personas and Use/Case Interaction Flows. We gor into groups when learning these subjects so not
			only did I learn a lot, I also got to talk with and interact with my classmates which was a great experience.
			Looking forward to next week.</p>
